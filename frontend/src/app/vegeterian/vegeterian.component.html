        <h1 id="header" >Vegetarian Meal Plan</h1>
        <p class="text-center">
            The vegetarian diet is a popular way of eating thanks to growing research on the health and environmental benefits of reducing meat, as well as concern for animal welfare. <br><br>
            Today, researchers agree that a vegetarian diet can be inherently healthy because it encourages eating vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and beans â€” all of which are chock-full of essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients.

    <p class="text-center">Research suggests that there are numerous advantages to going vegetarian. "Vegetarians tend to eat less saturated fat and cholesterol, and more Vitamins C and E, folic acid, dietary fiber, potassium, 
        magnesium, and phytochemicals," says Michelle Zive, a registered dietitian and NASM-certified nutrition coach. <br> <br>
        
        "This means vegetarians are more likely to have lower total and bad cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index, all of which are associated with longevity and a decreased risk for many chronic diseases," says Zive. <br> <br>
        
        Studies have shown that vegetarians tend to have an overall better quality diet, and a higher intake of key nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, 
        vitamin E, and magnesium. <br>
